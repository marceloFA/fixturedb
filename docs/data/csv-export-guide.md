# CSV Export Guide

**Note:** For full database queries and raw source code access, see [Database Schema](../architecture/database-schema.md) or [Using the Dataset](../usage/usage.md).

This document describes all CSV files exported during `python pipeline.py export`.

## Export Structure

CSV files generated during export:

```
export/fixturedb_v<version>_<date>/
├── fixtures.db                (full database with all fields)
├── repositories.csv
├── test_files.csv
├── fixtures.csv               (raw_source excluded by default; use --include-source for full source)
├── stats.txt                  (summary statistics)
└── README.txt                 (schema documentation)
```

| `start_line` | INT | 1-indexed start line in source file |
| `end_line` | INT | 1-indexed end line in source file |
| `loc` | INT | Non-blank lines of code in fixture |
| `cyclomatic_complexity` | INT | McCabe complexity: 1 + number of branching statements |
| `cognitive_complexity` | INT | Nesting-depth-weighted complexity (higher = harder to understand) |
| `max_nesting_depth` | INT | Maximum block nesting level |
| `num_parameters` | INT | Number of function parameters |
| `num_objects_instantiated` | INT | Estimated constructor calls inside fixture (detected via regex; see limitations) |
| `num_external_calls` | INT | Estimated I/O / external API calls (DB, HTTP, filesystem, env); see limitations |
| `reuse_count` | INT | Number of test functions using this fixture |
| `has_teardown_pair` | INT | Binary indicator (0/1): whether fixture includes cleanup/teardown logic |
| `pinned_commit` | TEXT | SHA of analyzed commit (for reproducibility) |
| `github_url` | TEXT | Direct GitHub link to fixture source code (click to view in browser) |

## Design Rationale

### CSV Export Strategy

The public CSV exports contain **quantitative metrics only** for this dataset. The full SQLite database includes additional infrastructure columns for reproducibility and detailed mock framework analysis, but these are intentionally excluded from CSV exports:

**Internal-only fields (excluded from CSV):**
- `category` (fixture) — Internal fixture classification infrastructure; enables future taxonomy work
- `mock_usages` table (fixture framework analysis) — Detailed mock framework counts and interactions; available in SQLite database for researchers who need it

### Design principles

1. **Quantitative focus:** CSV exports contain only measurable, objective facts (LOC, counts, metrics, detection patterns)
2. **Context-rich:** Human-readable columns (repo, file_path, github_url) enable standalone analysis without database joins
3. **Reproducible:** Full SQLite database available for verification of extraction decisions
4. **Traceable:** github_url enables verification of any finding directly in source code on GitHub
5. **Archivable:** Zenodo deposit includes both SQLite (for transparency and future research) and CSV (for paper analysis and public sharing)
